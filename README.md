# cookiecutter-cli

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) template designed to help you get started with your [command-line interface (CLI)](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

### Using the Template

#### Step One: Build the project.
You can build a project directly from the github repository.

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/melMass/cookiecutter-click
```

#### Run the `make` Targets

There are several `make` targets so have a look at the `Makefile` if you're interested.

```bash
cd <project-name>
make install
make build
```

#### Run the Command-Line App

If you have performed the steps above, you should now be able to run the application by the project name.

```bash
<project-name> --help
```

If you get the template help message, you're ready to start building.
